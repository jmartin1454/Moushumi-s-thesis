\chapter{Introduction\label{ch:intro}}

This chapter will provide some information on why the neutron electric
dipole moment (nEDM) is interesting to measure.  Finding a nonzero
nEDM would answer questions regarding the matter-antimatter or baryon
asymmetry of the universe (BAU).  The measuremet principle of nEDM
experiment and the origin of systematic effects causing false EDM's
will be explained.  This will lead to a discussion on the importance
of magnetometry on nEDM experiment.

\section{CP violation and the Standard Model}

Charge conjugation (C), Parity (P) and Time-reversal (T) symmetry are
discrete symmetries in physics.  C-symmetry describes the symmetry of
physical laws under a particle-antiparticle transformation.
P-symmetry describes the inversion of spatial coordinates and
T-symmetry the direction of time.

CPT-symmetry is believed to be a good symmetry of nature because all
relativistic quantum field theories are invariant under successive
application of the three discrete symmetries.  This is known as the
CPT theorem.

Parity symmetry was discovered to be violated in the weak interaction
through observations of spin correlations in beta-decay.  This is due
to neutrinos having a particular handedness.  This problem can be
fixed proposing that CP-symmetry is a good symmetry of nature.
However, CP-symmetry has also been found to be violated in weak decays
of kaons and B-mesons.

The nEDM is an observable that if found to be non-zero, would indicate
a violation of T-symmetry.  Because of the CPT theorem this is
equivalent to CP-violation.  The current best measurement of the nEDM
gives the upper bound $|d_n|<3.0\times
10^{-26}~e\cdot$cm~\cite{PhysRevLett.97.131801,PhysRevD.92.092003}.
We now discuss how this result impacts physics within and beyond the
standard model.

CP violations in the standard model are arising from two separate
sources.  The first source is found in the strong interaction,
described by the $\theta$ term in the quantum chromodynamics (QCD)
Lagrangian.  This CP violating term in the QCD Lagrangian violates
both parity and time symmetry and induces a nEDM of
$|d_n|\sim-(0.9-1.2)\times
10^{−16}\theta~e\cdot$cm~\cite{bib:chuppetal} with $\theta$ being a
dimensionless parameter of the standard model.  A combination of nEDM
and Hg-EDM measurements limit the parameter to be very small
$\theta\lesssim 10^{-10}$.  The reason for the smallness of $\theta$
is currently unknown.  The second source of CP violation in the SM
arises from a complex phase in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)
matrix\cite{PhysRevLett.10.531}.  The phase is responsible for CP
violation in K and B meson decays.  the CP violation within the CKM
matrix predicts $|d_n| = 10^{-31} - 10^{-32}~e\cdot$cm, well below the
current best experimental limit stated above.
%This is known as the
%weak CP-problem since it arises through W boson
%exchange~\cite{PhysRevLett.82.904}.

The T-violating nEDM is considered to be one of the most promising probe for
physics beyond the Standard Model.

\section{Baryon asymmetry}

According to the Big Bang theory, matter and antimatter have been
created in equal amounts in the early universe. But the present
universe is overwhelmingly made up of matter rather than
anti-matter.
% The ratio of baryonic matter to photons can be expressed
%as
%\begin{equation}
%  \frac{n_B}{n_\gamma}=10^{-10}
%\end{equation}
%where $n_B$ is the difference between baryons and anti-baryons number
%and $n_\gamma$ is the number of photons in the Cosmic Backgorund.
The amount of baryon asymmetry generated in the standard model is much
smaller than current observations~\cite{bib:morrissey}.

The Sakharov conditions to explain baryon
asymmetry\cite{budker2013optical}\cite{PhysRevLett.10.531}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Baryon number violation.
    \item Violation of C-symmetry and therefore CP.
    \item Interactions away from thermal equilibrium
\end{itemize}
However, these conditions contain sources of C and CP violation which
haven't been observed so far. Since a non-zero EDM violates CP
Sakrov's conditions would be fulfilled by the existence of a neutron
EDM (nEDM).


\section{Neutron electric dipole moment and CP violation }  
Neutron has an intrinsic electric dipole moment (EDM).  ~The neutron
EDM is a measure for the distribution of positive and negative charges
inside the neutron\cite{wiki:yyy}. Intrinsic EDM of neutron
interacting with external magnetic and electric fields can be
described by the following Hamiltonian:
\begin{equation}\label{my_first_eqn}  
  H=-\mu_n.B-d_n.E
\end{equation}
where $\mu_n$ is the magnetic moment of the neutron interacting with the magnetic field B,and $d_n$ is the electric dipole moment of the neutron interacting with the electric field E.
Since the neutron spin is an axial vector and the electric dipole moment vector is a scalar
vector, both vectors behave differently under P- or T-transformations.  The orientation of the electric dipole moment changes under P operation  but leaves the magnetic moment unchanged. On the other hand, T-operation affects the spin vector but leaves the electric dipole moment unchanged.
 Because of the conservation of CPT symmetry, a non-zero electric dipole moment of the neutron would be a violation of parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetry.

\section{nEDM measurement principle}
The Ramsey's method of separated oscillatory fields is the well-known measurement technique
to extract the neutron EDM. In the nEDM experiment, spin-polarized ultracold neutrons, oriented along a uniform field $B_0$ stored into a neutron storage chamber. After applying the magnetic field $B_0$ along the z-axis of the storage cell, the ultra-cold neutrons start to precess about magnetic field $B_0$ at their Larmor frequency.  Then a radio frequency pulse at the Larmor frequency of the neutron is applied to flip the spin by $90 \degree$. The applied electric field is in a collinear orientation to B.  For parallel orientation of E and B, the rotational frequency becomes
\begin{equation}\label{my_first_eqn}  
    h{\omega_0}^ {\uparrow\uparrow}=2\mu_n {B}^{\uparrow\uparrow}+ 2 d_nE
\end{equation}
            
and for the antiparallel orientation of E and B, the rotational frequency is given by
\begin{equation}\label{my_first_eqn}  
    h{\omega_0}^ {\uparrow\downarrow}=2\mu_n {B}^{\uparrow\downarrow}- 2 d_nE
\end{equation}

where $\mu_n$ denotes the neutron magnetic moment, and $d_n$ denotes the hypothetical electric dipole moment. When the value of nEDM is zero, the neutron spin orientation will be anti-parallel to the initial spin orientation but the spin orientation will no longer antiparallel for non-zero nEDM. A fully magnetized Fe-foil is used to detect the neutron spin while transmitting the neutron from neutron chamber which is used to get information about spin orientation. The probability of neutron transmission is proportional to the neutron spin projection on the preferred direction of the Fe-foil. A neutron counter is used to detect the transmitted UCNs. A spin flipper is used to flip the remaining UCNs in the storage chamber in the preferred direction and then they are passed through the neutron counter. An incident for the nEDM is determined from the ratio of the counting rates.

\section{Origin of False EDM}
The dominant sources of systematic error for all previous or proposed EDM experiments come from magnetic field instability (uncorrelated with the electric field E), and magnetic field inhomogeneity through the geometric phase effect.  The effect is easiest to understand by considering transverse fields originating from the gradient of the uniform $B_0$  field in the axial direction (z direction).  Now in the presence of electric field E, the experienced additional magnetic field by an UCN particle moving at a speed v on it’s own rest frame can be written as,
\begin{equation}
  B_v = \frac{v*E}{c^2}
  \label{equation:phase effect}
\end{equation}
 Since the particle moves in the EDM cell, these radial fields also rotate. The rotation frequency of radial field is the same frequency as particles move in the EDM cell.  Therefore, the transverse rotating field induce a phase shift on the resonant frequency from the central value.  This phase shift is known as Ramsey-Bloch-Siegert shift which is proportional to the electric-field strength and therefore mimics an EDM signal. 
 To analyze this effect, the field rotations may be represented in terms of a perturbation on the precession phase. The phase is shifted in 2nd order, resulting in a geometric phase effect.  False EDM effects arise from the interplay between the radial component of the applied $B_0$  field and $B_v$ in the 2nd order perturbation.

\section{ Magnetometry Impact on nEDM}
Ensuring magnetic field stability and homogeneity is one of the key factors to measure nEDM precisely. For that purpose, our collaboration is planning to use dual species comagnetometer inside the UCN cell and an array of highly sensitive all optical atomic magnetometer surrounding the cell. Cesium/Rubidium is used in a set of external magnetometers surrounding the storage chamber.
\subsection{Comagnetometer}
To date,~$^{199}Hg$ is the only atomic element that has been used as a co-magnetometer for a neutron EDM experiment\cite{PhysRevLett.97.131801}\cite{PhysRevLett.102.101601}.  polarized mercury atoms precess in the same volume as the neutrons, hence probing approximately the same space- and time-averaged magnetic field.  Comgnetometry is an ideal tool to correct for field drifts.  So 1-10 pT drifts in $B_0$  may be corrected using the comagnetometer technique, setting a goal magnetic stability for the B0  field generation system in a typical nEDM experiment\cite{PhysRevLett.97.131801}\cite{afach:in2p3-01062292}. In nEDM experiment, optical pumping is used to polarize the vapor of mercury atoms. Since the comagnetometer operation is synchronous with the nEDM measurement, injecting polarized mercury atoms and  neutron filling into the precession chamber occurs simultaneously. After the application of a $\pi/2$ pulse, the atoms start to precess freely around $B_0$. When a circularly polarized probe beam interact with precessing atoms the modulation of light intensity occurs and after further analysis of  this effect we get information about Larmor frequency of the atoms. A false nEDM signal may arise due to a combination of a magnetic field gradient @Bz=@z and motion in the electric field when species (neutrons and $^{199}Hg$ atoms) are confined in the measurement cells. In order to avoid the false nEDM problem, our proposed comagnetometer will be based on $^{199}Hg$ and $^{129}Xe$. Xe comagnetometer requires mTorr pressure of pure,
highly polarized Xe in the nEDM cell.
\subsection{Internal magnetometer}

In order to avoid any systematic effects, it becomes necessary to carefully investigate the magnetic field in the UCN storage chamber.  Toward this end, all optical atomic magnetometers will be used in the nEDM experiment at TRIUMF.  These magnetometers, like the mercury co-magnetometer, are scalar so they only measure the magnitude of the magnetic field.  The atomic  magnetometers will be placed in an array surrounding the precession chamber. This arrangement can be used to resolve the multipolarity of field perturbances. The most important advantage of using such all-optical atomic magnetometers is that only a polarized laser beam is used to interact with the magnetometer instead of using electrical cables which reduces the risk of additional sources of magnetic fields to the UCN storage chamber. Furthermore, Cs based magnetometers are low  maintenance and they don't have to be cooled with liquid He down to 4 K such as SQUIDs.  The sensitivity of Cs magnetometers can even surpass the sensitivity of SQUIDs. \\
In this Master's thesis, an introduction into the concept of full optical magnetometry will be presented. This will be continued with a status update, the presentation of measurements with our highly sensitive Rb magnetometer at The University of Winnipeg.
