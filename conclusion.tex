\section{Summary of Results of the Thesis}
\section{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
\item	FEMM simulation of z-coil 	Homogeneity of z-coil in this shielding configuration is not known or measured.  (Never measured with endcaps of innermost shield removed.)
\begin{itemize}
\item Probably this is to compare with Junyao’s coil and its homogeneity

\item
Can also measure homogeneity of z-coil in shield – it has been done before and I recall that it is homogeneous at $\% $level when in shield with basic degaussing (not our present degaussing system).
\end{itemize}
\item
Study magnetometer performance with Junyao's coil inside shield. 
\begin{itemize}
\item	The idea here is to show whether decoupling the coil from the shield has any impact on long-term stability.
 \item removing the lock-in amplifier
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Farther Future}
Build nEDM experiment.
