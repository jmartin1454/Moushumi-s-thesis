\section{Summary of Results of the Thesis}
\begin{itemize}
\item Measurements of magnetic fields over long timescales using FID mode.

Conclusion: fields drift over time.  Question: how much is due to
 magnetometer drift vs. other sources?

\item The study based on the adjustment of the pump and probe time Allowed us to measure faster.e the field faster.
  
Conclusion: Allowed us to measure faster.
\item Magnetometer drift compared with drifts in the coil current and
  room temperature.  This study aimed at finding sources of drifts.
  
Conclusion: neither drift seems
particularly correlated with field drift over long time periods.
 Temperature stability seems quite good, consistent with Michi's
 thesis.  Side conclusion: when field {\bf only} is changed, the
 magnetometer responds as expected.  Implies that magnetometer works
 well at sensing small changes in field, at least on shorter
 timescales.
\item Studies of degaussing, which in part tell the story of our
  degaussing development and learning.  This includes studies of:
%with multiple goals, telling the story of
%  our degaussing
  \begin{itemize}
    \item the degaussing setup and testing it near zero field
    
Conclusion:we set up the
     system, we tested mainly sample rate (related to number of
     oscillations) stated to be important in Thiel et al.\cite{doi:10.1063/1.2713433}  We found
     that if the innermost shield was already degaussed that
     additional poor/rapid degauss did not screw it up as badly as we
     expected, until degaussing was very rapid.
    \item initial operations at non-zero field, and
Ramp field to large values, without
    degaussing was bad.  After degaussing was better.
    
    \item final degaussing procedure, in which degaussing the next to
      innermost shield was studied.
  \end{itemize}
\item Studies of laser locking and tuning, and the requirements on
  tune stability
  \end{itemize}
again multiple goals:
 \begin{itemize}
   \item Lock point or laser seems to drift over time.  See ``Drift
    is about 120 pT'' where statistical error gets worse.  Also
     would lose lock sometimes.  We think this may be due to PBS.
    \item Other concern is whether drift of lock affects measured
     field.  
     
     Conclusion: Studied by ``manual locking'' and found not to be
     important.  Lock drift does not affect measured field drift very
    much, but does affect statistical precision of magnetometer.
%  \end{itemize}
\item Studies pushing below 1~pT in an individual FID measurement.
  This includes adjustment of the pump and probe powers, and lock-in
  amplifier settings.  As will be shown, this study revealed problems
  in the procedures used to determine the precession frequency at such
  high precision and suggests avenues for further study.
%But when
%  we improved the statistical precision significantly, we began to run
%  into systematic errors in frequency measurement.  This led us to
%  study additional errors related to lock-in amplifier settings.
%  Future work is to finalize these studies in order to further reduce
%  the errors
\item Finally, I show my studies which revealed a way to use FID mode
  to measure transverse fields.
%Further work is
%  required to push to nT-scale transverse fields relevant for
%  typ.~unmeasurable gradients that enter $\delta_T$ correction in Hg-n
%  signals in nEDM experiments.

\section{Future work}
\begin{itemize}
\item	FEMM simulation of z-coil 	Homogeneity of z-coil in this shielding configuration is not  measured with endcaps of innermost shield removed.
\begin{itemize}

\item
Can also measure homogeneity of z-coil in shield â€“ it has been done before and I recall that it is homogeneous at $1\% $level when in shield with basic degaussing (not our present degaussing system).
\end{itemize}
\item
Study magnetometer performance with self-shielded coil (Junyao's coil) inside shield instead of our present z-coil. 
\begin{itemize}
\item	The idea here is to show whether decoupling the coil from the shield has any impact on long-term stability.
\end{itemize}
 \item Removing the lock-in amplifier from data  acquisition system of field measurement. The idea is to collect signal directly from photodiode and use digital/ analogue filter for further data analysis  instead of demodulating the FID signal through lock-in amplifier 

\end{itemize}

\section{Farther Future}
Build nEDM experiment:

The work presented in this thesis is based on measuring magnetic field stability and homogeneities which is a part of the TUCAN's future nEDM measurement at TRIUMF. Measuring nEDM within the sensitivity level of $10^{-27}$ e.cm is the goal for this experiment. Study magnetic field stability is very crucial because the best previous nEDM measurements showed that
